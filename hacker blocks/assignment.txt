You are given number of pages in n different books and m students. 
The books are arranged in ascending order of number of pages.
 Every student is assigned to read some consecutive books. 
 The task is to assign books in such a way that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum.


Input Format
First line contains integer t as number of test cases. 
Next t lines contains two lines. For each test case, 1st line contains
 two integers n and m which represents the number of books and students 
 and 2nd line contains n space separated integers which represents the
  number of pages of n books in ascending order.



Constraints
1 < t < 50
1< n < 100
1< m <= 50
1 <= Ai <= 1000


Output Format
Print the maximum number of pages that can be assigned to students.


Sample Input
1
4 2
12 34 67 90
Sample Output
113 
Explanation
1st students : 12 , 34, 67 (total = 113)
2nd students : 90 (total = 90)
Print max(113, 90)






The coding blocks members went to the success party of their first ever online boot-camp at Murthal.
 They ordered P number of paranthas. The stall has L cooks and each cook has a rank R. 
 A cook with a rank R can cook 1 parantha in the first R
  minutes 1 more parantha in the next 2R minutes, 1 more parantha in
   3R minutes and so on(he can only cook a complete parantha) 
   ( For example if a cook is ranked 2.. he will cook one parantha in 
   2 minutes one more parantha in the next 4 mins and one more in the next 
   6 minutes hence in total 12 minutes he cooks 3 paranthas. In 13 minutes also he
    can cook only 3 paranthas as he does not have enough time for the 4th parantha).
     Calculate the minimum time needed to cook all the paranthas.


Input Format
First line contains P, the number of pratha ordered. I
n the next line the first integer denotes the number of cooks L and L integers
 follow in the Next line each denoting the rank of a cook.


Constraints
P <= 1000
L <= 50
1 <= R <= 8


Output Format
Print an integer which tells the number of minutes needed to get the order done.


Sample Input
10
4 
1 2 3 4
Sample Output
12
Explanation
First cook with rank 1 cooks 4 paranthas in 10 minutes (1+2+3+4).
Second cook with rank 2 cooks 3 paranthas in 12 minutes (2+4+6)
Third cook with rank 3 cooks 2 paranthas in 9 minutes (3+6) Fourth cook with rank 4 only needs to
 cook one last remaining parantha. He can do that in 4 minutes.
Since these cooks cook parallely, the total time taken will be the maximum of the four i.e. 12 minutes.






maximum circular sum ---
 it is also knows as maximum circular subarray sum --- which is the extended version of kadane's algorithm
 in this question we need to find the maximum subarray sum 
  the mathimatical sum of all the subbarrays are  (n * (n+1))/2

  nums[(i + 1) % n] and the previous element of nums[i] is nums[(i - 1 + n) % n].
