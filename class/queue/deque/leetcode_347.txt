leetcode 347  top k frequent elements 
hashmap to store frequency 

comparator to sort priority queue according to freqency (priority queue of hashmap )

we can make priority queue of any data structure  we can even make priority queue of hashmap

travel hashmap and push each key-value to priority queue 
remove and print first


we make comparator that sort using frequency --

1 , -1, 0 comparator 


hashmap comparator ---
PriorityQueue <HashMap<Integer,Integer>>pq
new PriorityQueue<>((a,b)-----b.getValue().compareTo(a.getValue()));
