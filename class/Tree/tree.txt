for a binary TREE 

number of nodes are --- (2^h) -1  --- h start fromm 0

height = log(n+1)-base2



BST --- BINARY SEARCH TREE 
root's left will be smaller than root's value

root's right will be larger than roots's value




heap --- minheap: both children(if they exist) --- are greater than the parent
maxheap ---- both children (if they exis) are smaller than the parent 


balanced , unbalanced trees
