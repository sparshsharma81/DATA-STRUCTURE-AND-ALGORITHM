int x = 1;-- 
time and space COMPLEXICITY --- O(1)

similarly
int x = 2; 
int y = 2; 
int z = 3;
they have time and space complexicity -- O(3)

O(3) = O(1)


in case of loops;;;
for(int i =0 ; i<n; i++){
    x+=6;

}

for(int j = 0 ; j<x;j++){
    y+=7;
}

this is known as linear search --- O(n) = O(2n) 



O(1) ---- constant time and space complexicity.
O(n) --- linear time/space complexicity 
O(n^2) --- quadratic time complexicity;
O(log n)--- logarithmic time complexicity
