if stack is empty and we are trying to peek or pop..then it will show stack underflow exception

if stack is full and we are trying to push element..then it will give stack overflow error
the overflow occur when the memory of stack is full or if we are implementing it using array---array has fixed memory...
so it will show stack overflow error
